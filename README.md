## About the EcoRestoration Alliance (ERA)
This project is sponsored by the EcoRestoration Alliance (ERA). 

>ERA promotes restoration of healthy biodiverse ecosystems as a holistic response to the urgent crises of climate and biodiversity. We bring together scientists, earth stewards, storytellers and grassroots leaders to accelerate the restoration of degraded lands and waters, foster biodiversity, and cool the planet.

## Where do you fit in?
This is a 100% volunteer-driven project. Our current volunteers come from a wide range of backgrounds and contribute to the project in very different ways. What we have in common is a commitment to climate action, a collaborative spirit, and a deep belief in the potential of regular people to make a big difference. If you have these qualities and a little extra time on your hands, please reach out! 

We're especially in need of volunteers with the following skills:
- GIS and webmap app development (Esri suite, QGIS, etc.)
- Coding / development
- Knowledge and resource curation
- User Research
- Grant writing

Below is a short list of some of our current planned activities, which we will continue to update as the project progresses. Activities are grouped by 
- Development of the Big Map prototype, including:
-- Integration of Experience Builder application with social media, especially through social media post templates and builder and RSS feed
-- 
- Grant research and proposal development
-- 

Volunteers are also encouraged to pitch their own ideas for future development. Our work style is open and highly collaborative, and many of our tasks are designed to be self-guided.
